Data Insights for Crypto Wallet Trends and Send Crypto Funds Cross Chain with Axelar

Current tools in the web 3 ecosystem offer limited insight into the data insights of web 3 wallets, and are even more limited when considering cross-chain solutions. This is a pressing need as web 3 payment continues to gain popularity with web 2 companies, and the use cases are expanding into a wider range of purchases to support every day living. Wallet Wire aims to solve this problem by providing deeper data insights into wallets, irrespective of chain affliation. Transactions are grouped into categories for custodians to easily manage budgets for their wallets and see trends within categories. Additionally, using the Axelar cross chain payment functionality users are able to send crypto funds to other users. (This is the MVP for the dapp. More work is needed to achieve full functionality.)
